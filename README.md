### Things

[Demo](https://agentcooper.github.io/svelte-things).

This is an open-source clone of [Things app](https://culturedcode.com/things/).

The goal of the project was to play around with [Svelte framework](https://svelte.technology) and CSS. The non-goal is to replicate the whole app.

If you like the app, please buy the full version.
